Normal procedure:
Client send request{type:get_worker} to proxy's well-known listenning socket, 
proxy accept the request, and select a worker{IP,Port}.
Client recieve {IP,Port}, using it to connect the worker,
Client send request to worker{type:request, ID:hostname+timestamp, file_length, file_md5}, 
Worker accept request, increment request_count, send to proxy,forker child, return ack{type:ack, child_process_id}.
Client send the whole file(since file length send before, worker know when to stop recieve),
Worker forker a child to recieve it, store it as a file, named it hostname+timestamp, caculate md5. 
Once succeed, worker fork a child and execv the computation program given that data file, store the result file, then terminate.
Parent process wait child to terminate, and send a header{type:result, file_length, md5}, and then the actual file.
Once client successfully ack, worker update request_count, and send to proxy from handler of SIGCHILD.
Proxy recieve the message, update request_count.

Startup:
Proxy creat two sockets, one interact with clients, another local socket deal with workers(register, notify task success or failure) .
When worker start up, it register itself to local socket, proxy record the worker, store then as a list, using it when load balancing.

Exception handle:
Client detect worker unresponsible, send request{type:reget_worker, previous worker, child_process},
Proxy send message to that worker to terminate the child_process. If Proxy find worker unresponsible, mark worker as unresponsible to prevent it from select(all previous client will detect this, and re_request). proxy reselect a worker.
Worker detect client unresponsible, terminate child process, and tell proxy to decrement request_count. It's upto cient to repair itself, either terminate or re_request.
If proxy failed, all assigned job will complete succesfully because they don't need proxy to interact. But all new request will fail, and worker's task result will also fail.
